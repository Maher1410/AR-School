## Overview

AR School is a cutting-edge application designed to revolutionize the educational experience by bringing static 2D images to life through 3D visualization and interactive learning. Utilizing advanced Augmented Reality (AR) technology, AR School allows users to convert 2D images from books, computers, or any other source into dynamic 3D objects. Accompanied by videos and audio explanations, these 3D representations enhance understanding and engagement in scientific and academic subjects, making learning not only more accessible but also more enjoyable.

## Features

- **2D to 3D Conversion**: Instantaneously transform any 2D image into a 3D model with just the placement of a camera.
- **Educational Content**: Access a wide range of videos and audio explanations to complement the 3D models, enriching the learning experience.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with the 3D models through interactive features, enhancing comprehension and retention of academic concepts.
- **Cross-Platform**: Whether you are using a book, a computer screen, or any digital device, AR School bridges the gap between traditional and digital learning.
